My research interests lie in the intersection of differential geometry, mathematical physics and partial differential equations. I am particularly interested in the analytical and geometric aspects of solutions to heat equations arising from geometric variational problems such as the harmonic map, mean curvature, Ricci and Yang-Mills flows.

The following is a list of my preprints and publications:
