I am a postdoctoral associate in the geometric analysis group at the Free University of Berlin. I was previously employed as a postdoctoral associate at the Leibniz University of Hannover and undertook a Ph.D. at the Free University of Berlin under the supervision of Prof. Klaus Ecker with funding from the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics. I had previously received funding from the Berlin Mathematical School for the first phase of their Ph.D. program.

If you would like to learn more, please feel free to get in touch with me.
